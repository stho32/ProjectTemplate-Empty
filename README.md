# Project

See [requirements](Documentation/Requirements.md) for the instructions.

The folder "Provided-Files" contains the files provided for the project.

You might also be interested in my [notes](Documentation/Notes.md) where I share my thoughts about why I chose one way of solution over another. 

And here you can find my [pomodoro-log](Documentation/Pomodoro-Log.md) for the project.
